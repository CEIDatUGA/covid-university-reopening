# COVID University Reopening

Significant uncertanties remain concerning the opening of college and university campuses in the United States due to COVID-19. We assembled quantitative empirical information about several processes likely to affect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within institutions of higher education. Preliminary results suggest that campuses should anticipate explosive localized outbreaks and be prepared for significant levels of transmission associated with the congregation of students. We identify off-campus student-student interactions to be the arena of intervention with the greatest opportunity for significant reductions in transmission.
