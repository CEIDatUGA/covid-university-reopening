  abstract  = "Various types of face masks available to the general public are
               worn for protection against inhalation of dust, pollutants,
               allergens, and pathogenic organisms. Recent news stories have
               illustrated the widespread use of face masks for protection
               against Swine flu (H1N1), Severe Acute Respiratory Distress
               Syndrome (SARS), Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus
               outbreaks in Asia, and dust from the collapse of the World Trade
               Center. However, the level of protection provided by face masks
               is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine how
               efficiently face masks prevent respiratory exposure to
               potentially harmful aerosols. Three types of commonly available
               face masks were tested: a surgical mask, a pre-shaped dust mask,
               and a bandana. An N95 respirator was tested as the positive
               control. Masks were fit onto a Styrofoam? mannequin head
               modified with a 5/8-inch diameter sample probe that was placed
               inside a 147.5 liter test plenum; a 5/8-inch diameter reference
               probe was positioned next to the mannequin head. Saline aerosols
               were generated in the test plenum using an IV HEART? (Westmed,
               Inc., Tucson, AZ) nebulizer. Each face mask was challenged for
               30 minutes. Filter samples were collected simultaneously from
               the mannequin and reference sample probes and used to calculate
               aerosol concentrations. The mannequin sample probe and the
               reference sample probe volumetric flow rates were 8.75 L/min and
               1.72 L/min, respectively. The mean challenge aerosol
               concentration, determined from the reference sample probe, was
               0.045 $\pm$ 0.008 mg/L with a mass median aerodynamic particle
               size of 1.6 ?m. Face mask protective efficiency was calculated
               as the ratio of mannequin sample probe concentration to
               reference sample probe concentration. The protective
               efficiencies were 33.3\%, 11.3\%, and 6.1\% for the surgical,
               bandana, and dust masks, respectively. The N95 mask protective
               efficiency was 89.6\%. In conclusion, the surgical mask
               protected the best of the three face masks tested. However, it
               is important to note that all three masks offer very little
               protection when compared to the N95, and wearing these face
               masks may produce a false sense of protection.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic,
              caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
              (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan city, Hubei province, in December,
              2019, and has spread throughout China. Understanding the evolving
              epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond
              Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention
              policy. METHODS: We collected individual information from
              official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported
              outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb
              17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case
              definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods
              (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom
              onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of
              cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian
              approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number
              (Rt) at the provincial level. FINDINGS: We collected data on 8579
              cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years
              (33-56), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age
              groups and in elderly people (ie, aged >64 years) as the epidemic
              progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital
              admission decreased from 4·4 days (95\% CI 0·0-14·0) for the
              period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2·6 days (0·0-9·0) for the period
              of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire
              period was estimated at 5·2 days (1·8-12·4) and the mean serial
              interval at 5·1 days (1·3-11·6). The epidemic dynamics in
              provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently
              included a mixture of case importations and local transmission.
              We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3
              weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1·08 (95\% CI
              0·74-1·54) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1·71
              (1·32-2·17) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which
              we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be
              below the epidemic threshold (ie, <1) after Jan 30.
              INTERPRETATION: Our estimates of the incubation period and serial
              interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of
              infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of
              symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic
              progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly,
              thus shortening the window of transmission in the community.
              Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures,
              movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population
              might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of
              SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province. FUNDING: National Science Fund

  abstract = "Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
              poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges;
              either they open their doors to students in September or they
              risk serious financial consequences. Objective: To define severe
              acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening
              performance standards that would permit the safe return of
              students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020
              semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic
              modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students
              without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic
              SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision
              and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental
              epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of
              varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity
              (ie, 70\%-99\%), specificity (ie, 98\%-99.7\%), and cost (ie,
              \$10/test-\$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5,
              and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional
              infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a
              symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05\% and a 30\% probability
              that infection would eventually lead to observable
              COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were
              for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered
              to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main
              Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs;
              daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness;
              and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the
              hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8\%) with
              no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2\%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
              Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70\% sensitivity,
              a test with 98\% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student
              infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116,
              with 21 students (18\%) with true-positive results. Screening
              every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean
              daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37\%) with
              true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840
              cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121
              students, with 108 students (90\%) with true-positive results.
              Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated
              with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did
              not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to
              contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered.
              Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with
              70\% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy
              for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening
              costs of \$470, \$910, or \$120, respectively, per student per
              semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling
              study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and
              even poorly sensitive (>70\%) test, coupled with strict
              behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated
              to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and
              permit the safe return of students to campus.",

              Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate pooled estimates.
              Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicated a

              respiratory illness (CRI) (risk ratio [RR] = 0.59; 95\%

              phase. Of asymptomatic individuals, 93.3\% (28/30) and 81.1\%
              (30/37) had reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels,
              respectively, during the early convalescent phase, as compared to
              96.8\% (30/31) and 62.2\% (23/37) of symptomatic patients. Forty
              percent of asymptomatic individuals became seronegative and
              12.9\% of the symptomatic group became negative for IgG in the
              early convalescent phase. In addition, asymptomatic individuals
              exhibited lower levels of 18 pro- and anti-inflammatory
              cytokines. These data suggest that asymptomatic individuals had a
              weaker immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reduction in
              IgG and neutralizing antibody levels in the early convalescent
              phase might have implications for immunity strategy and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Spain is one of the European countries most affected
              by the COVID-19 pandemic. Serological surveys are a valuable tool
              to assess the extent of the epidemic, given the existence of
              asymptomatic cases and little access to diagnostic tests. This
              nationwide population-based study aims to estimate the
              seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain at national and
              regional level. METHODS: 35 883 households were selected from
              municipal rolls using two-stage random sampling stratified by
              province and municipality size, with all residents invited to
              participate. From April 27 to May 11, 2020, 61 075 participants
              (75·1\% of all contacted individuals within selected households)
              answered a questionnaire on history of symptoms compatible with
              COVID-19 and risk factors, received a point-of-care antibody
              test, and, if agreed, donated a blood sample for additional
              testing with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay.
              Prevalences of IgG antibodies were adjusted using sampling
              weights and post-stratification to allow for differences in
              non-response rates based on age group, sex, and census-tract
              income. Using results for both tests, we calculated a
              seroprevalence range maximising either specificity (positive for
              both tests) or sensitivity (positive for either test). FINDINGS:
              Seroprevalence was 5·0\% (95\% CI 4·7-5·4) by the point-of-care
              test and 4·6\% (4·3-5·0) by immunoassay, with a
              specificity-sensitivity range of 3·7\% (3·3-4·0; both tests
              positive) to 6·2\% (5·8-6·6; either test positive), with no
              differences by sex and lower seroprevalence in children younger
              than 10 years (10\%) and lower in coastal areas (<3\%).
              Seroprevalence among 195 participants with positive PCR more than
              14 days before the study visit ranged from 87·6\% (81·1-92·1;
              both tests positive) to 91·8\% (86·3-95·3; either test positive).
              In 7273 individuals with anosmia or at least three symptoms,
              seroprevalence ranged from 15·3\% (13·8-16·8) to 19·3\%
              (17·7-21·0). Around a third of seropositive participants were
              asymptomatic, ranging from 21·9\% (19·1-24·9) to 35·8\%
              (33·1-38·5). Only 19·5\% (16·3-23·2) of symptomatic participants
              who were seropositive by both the point-of-care test and
              immunoassay reported a previous PCR test. INTERPRETATION: The
              majority of the Spanish population is seronegative to SARS-CoV-2
              infection, even in hotspot areas. Most PCR-confirmed cases have
              detectable antibodies, but a substantial proportion of people
              with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 did not have a PCR test
              and at least a third of infections determined by serology were
              asymptomatic. These results emphasise the need for maintaining
              public health measures to avoid a new epidemic wave. FUNDING:

              epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for
              clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has
              important implications for surveillance and control
              activities.Objective:To estimate the length of the incubation
              period of COVID-19 and describe its public health
              implications.Design:Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases
              reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020.Setting:News
              reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and
              countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province,
              China.Participants:Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
              outside Hubei province, China.Measurements:Patient demographic
              characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom
              onset, fever onset, and hospitalization.Results:There were 181
              confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset
              windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median
              incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95\% CI, 4.5 to
              5.8 days), and 97.5\% of those who develop symptoms will do so
              within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These
              estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of
              every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms
              after 14 days of active monitoring or
              quarantine.Limitation:Publicly reported cases may overrepresent
              severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from
              that of mild cases.Conclusion:This work provides additional
              evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of
              approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support
              current proposals for the length of quarantine or active
              monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although
              longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme
              cases.Primary Funding Source:U.S. Centers for Disease Control and

              performance standards that would permit the safe return of
              students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020

              modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students
              without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic
              SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision

              and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional
              infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a
              symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05\% and a 30\% probability
              that infection would eventually lead to observable
              COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were

              hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8\%) with
              no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2\%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
              Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70\% sensitivity,
              a test with 98\% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student
              infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116,
              with 21 students (18\%) with true-positive results. Screening
              every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean
              daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37\%) with
              true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840
              cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121
              students, with 108 students (90\%) with true-positive results.
              Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated
              with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did
              not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to
              contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered.
              Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with
              70\% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy
              for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening
              costs of \$470, \$910, or \$120, respectively, per student per
              semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling
              study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and
              even poorly sensitive (>70\%) test, coupled with strict
              behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated
              to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and
              permit the safe return of students to campus.",
